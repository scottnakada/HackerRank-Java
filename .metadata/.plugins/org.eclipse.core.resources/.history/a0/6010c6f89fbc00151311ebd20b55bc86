/*
 * Selection Sort
 * 
 * The selection sort is a combination of searching and sorting. During each pass,
 * the unsorted element with the smallest (or largest) value is moved to its proper
 * position in the array. The number of times the sort passes through the array is
 * one less than the number of items in the array. In the selection sort, the inner
 * loop finds the next smallest (or largest) value and the outer loop places that
 * value into its proper location.
 * 
 * Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms
 * since none of the loops depend on the data in the array. Selecting the lowest
 * element requires scanning all n elements (this takesn - 1 comparisons) and then
 * swapping it into the first position. Finding the next lowest element requires
 * scanning the remaining n - 1 elements and so on,
 * for (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n(n - 1) / 2 ~= O(n2) comparisons. Each
 * of these scans requires one swap for n - 1 elements. -
